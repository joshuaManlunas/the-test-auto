# The ultimate test framework template

This template is a general purpose template I have created based on years of experience creating and developing test 
automation frameworks for different organisations.  

## Description

This framework deals with typical legacy corporate applications where logging-in is the costliest process because nobody 
thought of testability when tha application was built. As test automation engineers, we tend to build test automation where we log-in once and then do all necessary 
testing in that single session. This is especially true when the application is already pipelined, a nd we need to be able to run automated 
tests during the deployment of these applications.

If you decide to use this template please credit me as the original author and give credit where credit is due.
